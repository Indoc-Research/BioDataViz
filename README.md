# BioDataViz

**BioDataViz** is an intuitive and user-friendly tool designed for biomedical researchers to visualize their data and perform statistical analysis without the need for any coding proficiency. The core philosophy behind **BioDataViz** is to enable seamless data exploration through a **graphical user interface (GUI)**, with the ability to generate customizable plots and carry out statistical computations interactively within **Jupyter Notebooks**.

Additionally, **BioDataViz** offers a **learning experience** for users who want to grow their Python skills. While the GUI handles the complexity, users can output the Python code behind their visualizations and analyses, allowing them to see how it works under the hood. This teaching feature is designed to gradually introduce non-programmers to Python, helping them learn how to manipulate data and generate custom plots through code.

## Features

- **GUI-Based Data Visualization**: Create complex and customizable plots directly from a GUI, with no coding experience required.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical computations, such as descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and more, all through an easy-to-use interface.
- **Learn Python by Example**: Output the code that generates the plots and analyses, empowering users to see how the operations are performed in Python.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook Integration**: Work within Jupyter Notebooks, combining powerful interactivity and live visualizations.
- **LLM-Assisted Learning**: Leverage large language models for interactive guidance and suggestions as you learn Python and explore data.

## Getting Started

At this stage, **BioDataViz** is still in its early development phase and contains only an **initial proof-of-concept**. The current version provides basic functionality for data visualization and statistics through the GUI, but there is much more to come in future iterations!

## Roadmap

- Expand GUI functionalities to cover more complex statistical analyses and plots.
- Enhance the learning component with more code examples, tips, and interactive guidance.
- Create documentation and video tutorials to assist new users.
